                <h3>Self-Doubt</h3>
                <p>That nagging voice telling you "you're not good enough" or "who are you to do this?" It whispers fears and amplifies every past failure. Self-doubt makes you question your abilities before you even begin, creating a mental barrier that feels insurmountable.</p>

                <p>Well-meaning friends, family, or colleagues who say "be realistic" or "that's impossible." These external voices reflect their own limitations onto your aspirations. They project their fears and missed opportunities, trying to keep you in a comfortable zone that fits their worldview.</p>

                <p>The feeling that you lack the skills, experience, or credentials to pursue your dream. Impostor syndrome makes you focus on what you don't have rather than what you do. You compare your beginning to someone else's middle, forgetting that everyone starts somewhere.</p>
